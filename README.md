AlphaMWE: Construction of Multilingual Parallel Corpora with MWE Annotations

In this work, we present the construction of multilingual parallel corpora with annotation of multiword expressions (MWEs). 
The MWEs include the verbal MWEs (vMWEs) defined by the PARSEME shared task that have a verb as the head of the studied terms. 
The annotated vMWEs are also bilingual and multilingual aligned manually. The languages covered include English, Chinese, Polish, German, and two working langauges Arabic (Standard, Egyptian Arabic, Tunisian Arabic) and Italian (Standard and Dialectal). 
The original English corpus is taken from the PARSEME shared task in 2018. 
We performed machine translation of this source corpus followed by human post editing and annotation of target MWEs, some dialectal langauges being translated mannually from scratch becasue current MT systems donot support them at all. 
Strict quality control was applied for error limitation, i.e., each MT output sentence received first person post editing and annotation plus second person quality checking. 
One of our findings during corpora preparation is that accurate translation of MWEs presents challenges to MT systems. 
To facilitate further MT research, we present a categorisation of the error types encountered by MT systems in performing MWE related translations. 
To acquire a broader view of MT issues, we selected four popular and state-of-the-art MT models for comparisons namely Microsoft Bing Translator, GoogleMT, Baidu Fanyi and DeepL MT. Systran MT was added in the Arabic corpus creation.
Because of the noise removal, translation post editing and MWE annotation by human professionals, 
we believe AlphaMWE is an asset for cross-lingual and multilingual research, such as MT and information extraction. Our multilingual corpora are freely available for research community.

The original English source repo (https://gitlab.com/parseme/parseme_corpus_en)

Five portions of the files from ‘aa to ae’, 150 segments each.

License: since we use the English PARSEME dataset, we adopt the same license as the original dataset, i.e. CC-BY-SA 4.0

If you are interested in including your native languages into AlphaMWE (currently involved: English/Chinese/German/Polish/ working:Arabic/Italian/Spanish), please get in touch. We do think this is a good contribution to various native language processing in machine / AI era, in addition to lexical studies.

AlphaMWE was presented in MWE-LEX@COLING2020 on December 13th. Tereska and Sonia were present together with Lifeng during the Online QA session. We thank the co-chairs/orgnizers, and got good feedback from audiences at MWE WS. 

We thank Prof. Agata Savary, Uni. of Tours to link AlphaMWE to the  list of language resources and tools for Polish - CLIP platform http://clip.ipipan.waw.pl/LRT 

Extended journal paper conditional accepted to Journal of LRE, entitled "Towards a resource for multilingual lexicons: an MT assisted and human-in-the-loop multilingual parallel corpus with multi-word expression annotation".
